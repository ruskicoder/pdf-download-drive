## Installation

### Load as Unpacked Extension (Developer Mode)

1. **Download/Clone** this repository
2. **Open Chrome** and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. **Enable Developer Mode** (toggle in top-right corner)
4. **Click "Load unpacked"** and select the extension folder
5. **Pin the extension** to your toolbar for easy access

## Usage

### Automatic Interface

When you visit Google Drive (drive.google.com), the extension automatically injects a floating button (ðŸ“„) in the top-right corner.

### Download Single File

1. **Open a PDF file** in Google Drive preview mode (URL contains `/file/.../view`)
2. **Click the floating button** or extension icon
3. **Click "Download Current File"**
4. The PDF will be generated and downloaded with the original filename

### Download All Files in Folder

1. **Open a Google Drive folder** containing PDF files
2. **Click the floating button** or extension icon  
3. **Click "Download All Files in Folder"**
4. The extension will:
   - Use OCR to scan the entire folder for PDF files
   - Automatically detect all filenames ending with .pdf
   - Click on each file to open its preview
   - Download each file using the same process as single file download
   - Close preview and move to next file
   - Continue until all PDF files are downloaded
   - Show progress and status for each file

## How It Works

### PDF Generation Process

1. **File Detection**: Uses OCR to scan the entire Google Drive folder interface for PDF files
2. **Smart Filename Recognition**: Detects filenames ending with .pdf from visible text elements with Vietnamese character support
3. **UI Element Filtering**: Removes Google Drive interface elements while preserving international filenames
4. **Automated Clicking**: Simulates clicks on file elements using jQuery and native JavaScript events with unique element identification
5. **Preview Loading**: Opens each file in Google Drive's preview mode
6. **File Contamination Prevention**: Assigns unique identifiers to prevent page mixing between files
7. **Image Extraction**: Finds all blob images (PDF pages) in the preview with enhanced cache management
8. **High-Quality Conversion**: Uses HTML5 Canvas to maintain full resolution
9. **PDF Assembly**: Creates multi-page PDFs using jsPDF library with file identifier verification
10. **Smart Download**: Names files based on detected filenames from OCR scan with Vietnamese character preservation
11. **Cache Cleanup**: Multi-pass blob cache clearing with comprehensive reference removal

### Local Security

- **No External Requests**: Uses bundled jsPDF library to avoid CSP violations
- **No Data Collection**: All processing happens locally in your browser
- **Secure Downloads**: Files download directly to your default Downloads folder

## File Naming Convention

- **Single files**: `original-name.pdf`
- **Files from subfolders**: `subfolder-name-file.pdf` 
- **Google Drive titles**: Automatically extracted from page titles

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Manifest V3**: Modern Chrome extension format
- **Content Script**: Handles Google Drive page interaction
- **Background Service**: Manages tab creation and script injection
- **Popup Interface**: Provides user controls and status updates

### Permissions Required

- `activeTab`: Access current Google Drive tab
- `scripting`: Inject PDF generation scripts
- `tabs`: Create background tabs for processing
- `storage`: Save extension settings
- `downloads`: Manage PDF downloads

### Supported Formats

- PDF files in Google Drive preview mode
- Multi-page documents
- High-resolution output (maintains original quality)

## Fixed Issues

### Vietnamese Filename Processing âœ…

**Problem**: Vietnamese filenames like "MÃ¡y nÃ©n vÃ  há»‡ thá»‘ng khÃ­ nÃ©n.pdf" were being truncated to "ng khÃ­ nÃ©n.pdf" due to inadequate Unicode character support and overly aggressive UI element removal.

**Solution**:
- **Enhanced Unicode Support**: Added Vietnamese character ranges `\u00C0-\u024F` and `\u1E00-\u1EFF`
- **Conservative UI Filtering**: Improved prefix removal to preserve Vietnamese diacritics
- **Robust Fallback Processing**: Word-by-word reconstruction when direct pattern matching fails
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed debugging for Vietnamese character processing

### File Contamination Prevention âœ…

**Problem**: Downloaded files contained pages from previous files during bulk operations, causing cross-contamination between different PDFs.

**Solution**:
- **Unique File Identifiers**: Each file gets a unique identifier tag during processing
- **Verification System**: PDF assembly verifies pages belong to current file identifier
- **Isolated Processing**: Clear separation between file processing sessions
- **Enhanced Cache Management**: Multi-pass blob clearing with comprehensive reference removal

### Duplicate Download Prevention âœ…

**Problem**: Same first file was downloaded repeatedly instead of processing different files in bulk operations.

**Solution**:
- **Unique Element Identification**: Enhanced element selection to avoid selecting same file repeatedly
- **Progress Tracking**: Better tracking of which files have been processed
- **Element State Management**: Proper cleanup of selected elements after processing

### Cache Clearing Optimization âœ…

**Problem**: 
1. Cache was cleared too early, preventing page loads
2. Blob cache clearing reported 0 items cleared, indicating ineffective cleanup

**Solution**:
- **Timing Optimization**: Only clear cache after successful operations, not before
- **Multi-Pass Clearing**: Multiple attempts to clear blob cache with different strategies
- **Comprehensive Reference Removal**: Remove all blob references, temporary objects, and cached images
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Better logging of cache clearing effectiveness

### Panel Positioning Enhancement âœ…

**Problem**: Panel was centered and could interfere with Google Drive interface.

**Solution**:
- **Top-Right Positioning**: Moved panel to top-right corner with 7% vertical and 4% horizontal offset
- **Viewport Units**: Used responsive `vh` and `vw` units for consistent positioning
- **Dynamic Version Display**: Added automatic version display from manifest.json

### Content Security Policy (CSP) Resolution âœ…

**Problem**: Google Drive blocks external script loading with CSP errors:
```
Refused to load the script 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/2.5.1/jspdf.umd.min.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive
```

**Solution**: 
- **Local Library**: Bundled jsPDF library in extension files
- **Extension Resources**: Made jsPDF accessible via `chrome.runtime.getURL()`
- **Proper Loading**: Load scripts using extension's content security context
- **Background Injection**: Use Chrome's scripting API for proper script injection

### Background Tab Processing

**Problem**: Opening files in visible tabs interrupts user workflow

**Solution**:
- **Hidden Tabs**: Create tabs with `active: false`
- **Background Processing**: Process files without user seeing them
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Close tabs after successful download
- **Progress Feedback**: Show progress in popup without tab switching

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No files downloaded**
- Ensure you're in a Google Drive folder with PDF files
- Check that files are accessible (not restricted)
- Verify Chrome allows downloads from extensions

**Low quality output**
- Extension uses maximum available resolution
- Quality depends on Google Drive's preview rendering
- Try refreshing the file preview before downloading

**Extension not appearing**
- Refresh the Google Drive page
- Check extension is enabled in chrome://extensions/
- Look for the floating ðŸ“„ button in top-right corner

### Console Errors

Open Chrome DevTools (F12) to see detailed error messages:
- `No images with 'blob:' source found` - File may not be a PDF or not fully loaded
- `PDF generation failed` - Try refreshing and re-downloading
- `Download timeout` - Large files may need more time
